generate an array of random numbers

random numbers are from 100 to 999

user can input how many random numbers they want in the array from 10 to 200

if numbers are less than 10 or more than 200 ask user to retry

once array is sorted sorted ask to retry the program or quit

example:
 
How many random numbers would you like to generate: 100 <- This needs to be stored in a variable

rand() % 900 + 100;

blah1 blah2 blah3 .. blah100

first list the unsorted array of numbers

find the median

finally list the sorted array of numbers from highest to lowest
